        <h4>JSON- What is it?</h4>
        <p>From the official <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON site</a>: <i>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write.
            It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language,
            Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but
            uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.
            These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.</i>
        </p>
        <p>JSON is built on two structures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.</li>
            <li>An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.</li>
        </ul>

"explanation":"How can a comet have three tails?
Normally, a comet has two tails: an ion tail of
charged particles emitted by the comet and pushed
out by the wind from the Sun, and a dust tail of
small debris that orbits behind the comet but is
also pushed out, to some degree, by the solar wind.
Frequently a comet will appear to have only one tail
because the other tail is not easily visible from the
Earth. In the featured unusual image, Comet 2P/Encke
appears to have three  tails because the ion tail
split just near to the time when the image was taken.
The complex solar wind is occasionally turbulent and
sometimes creates unusual structure in an ion tail.
On rare occasions even ion-tail disconnection events
have been recorded. An image of the Comet Encke taken
two days later gives a perhaps less perplexing perspective.",

        <h4>Accessing the JSON object</h4>
        <p>The way we access the key-value pairs inside the JSON object is as follows.
        </p>

        <p data-height="593" data-theme-id="dark" data-slug-hash="dvoRzd" data-default-tab="js" data-user="iax333" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="dvoRzd" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/iax333/pen/dvoRzd/">dvoRzd</a> by Ivan Xa (<a href="http://codepen.io/iax333">@iax333</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

    <br>
    <p>The JSON object that is sent back to us is saved to "response" as a JSON object we can access via the line </p>
    <pre> var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText); </pre>
    <p> Then we access the object and its keys as </p>
    <pre>
response.copyright;
response.date;
response.explanation;
response.hdurl;
response.media_type;
response.service_version;
response.title;
response.url; </pre>
    <p> so on, so forth. You would have to save these calls to a variable if you want to use them later on in the code.
    If you don't know what "document.getElementById" does, or what "textContent" is, don't worry. We will be going over those
    in the next page.</p>

    <p> What's important is that we can interpret JSON objects with Javascript. In the next page, we will be
        learning how to manipulate the DOM and use our JSON object to add data to the DOM.
